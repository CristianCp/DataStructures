# DataStructures 2016-2 UTP: Homeworks

>the life is practice, and practice, just be a humble practitioner and help the others.

### Requirements
to run the homeworks you will need a c++ compiler (std11). The better way to do this is downloading  the raw file and run it.

in my computer I have an alias that looks like this :
```sh
user@xxxx$ alias gustavcompile='g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -O2 -o gustav.out'
```

run and compile :

```sh
user@xxxx$ gustavcompile $file && ./gustav.out #replace $file by your file.
```
Want to keep a local copy:
```sh
user@xxxx$ git clone https://github.com/heticor915/Datastructures
```
