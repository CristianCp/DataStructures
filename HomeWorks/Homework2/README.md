# Homework2

Develop a proper implementation in C++ of the *nth fibonacci number in O(log n)*, this homework were base on [Ivan Yurchenko](http://kukuruku.co/hub/algorithms/the-nth-fibonacci-number-in-olog-n) post for Gustavo's Datastructure class. 

 * Donald E. Knuth matrix usage.
 * Class of Matriz operations.
 * Measure time of normal implementation and this implementation. 
 
I'm no good at writing in english but I'm doing my best effort to solve this problem :smile:. 

And here's the code! :+1:

```cpp 
int x;
c++ implementation here!
```

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
### Run and Compile:

as I've mentioned previously the way to run this file is cloning the repo or getting the raw file :
```bash
user@evil-machine~: wget staticfile
user@evil-machine~: gustavcompile staticfile 
user@evil-machine~: time ./gustav.out  
```



### Time:
 O(2^n)[s] | O(log n)[s]
--------|-------
 1.2   | 3
 0   | 4
 0   | 4
 1.2   | 3

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [markdown-editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor) for Markdown parsing and usage in my homeworks. 
 * Vim the most cool editor. 
 * a C++ compiler.
